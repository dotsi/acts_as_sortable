ActsAsSortable
==============

This is a simple plugin to create default sorting orders for arrays
of ActiveRecord objects.

This plugin is pretty stupid, given the existence of sort_by, but
I'd never written a plugin before and felt like giving it a go.

Example
=======

class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_sortable :name, :created_at
end

# Now you get...
Thing.all.sort == Thing.all.sort_by { |t| [t.name, t.created_at] }
